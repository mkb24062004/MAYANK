to straight current carrying conductor of infinite length, (c) at the center of a square shaped current 
carrying coil, (d) at the center of an equilateral triangle shaped current carrying coil, (e) at the center of 
regular hexagon uniform electric field,(f) at the center of a polygon shaped current carrying conductor
